This is a simple tutorial to install and run a simple program which uses the _Simple Direct Media Library (SDL2)_ in a C program.

This tutorial assumes that you have installed and are familiar with running a C program as shown in the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Makerspace-KTH/c_programing_intro)

To summarize, the tutorial assumes that:

1. you are using either Windows (10 or 11), Ubuntu Linux, or Macos.
2. You have installed GNU C compiler (GCC) using the method described in the tutorial for your operating system. 
3. You are able able to successfully compile the a program using make.

A program with SDL libraries will not only require you to include and call the functions in the SDL library but also to provide the runtime libraries during the _linking_ process. The following sections describe how to install a SDL library (2 or 3) and to tell the compiler to use it and link your program against it, to create the executable that can be run on your machine.

## Installing SDL2 Libraries
SDL contains various libraries based on what type of functions are called. For example, the _SDL2\_mixer_ library contains functions to manage sound when creating games, while _SDL2\_ttf_ library helps in creating fonts. The libraries are separated based on their functions but also to ensure that only the required parts of the libraries are used for building the executable. The size of the library will have a influence on the size of the executable cerated.

### SDL2 on Ubuntu Linux

On Ubuntu linux, use the following command in the terminal to install the required libraries:

  $ sudo apt install -y libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-net-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
  
### SDL2 on Macos

On mac with _homebrew_ installed please use the following command in terminal to install the libraries:

    $ brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_net


### SDL2 on Windows

On widows with Msys2, please open the msys2 console and issue the following commands to install the SDL2 libraries.

    $ pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_mixer mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_net

Answer _Y_ to proceed with the installation.


## Installing SDL3 Libraries
SDL contains various libraries based on what type of functions are called. For example, the _SDL2\_mixer_ library contains functions to manage sound when creating games, while _SDL2\_ttf_ library helps in creating fonts. The libraries are separated based on their functions but also to ensure that only the required parts of the libraries are used for building the executable. The size of the library will have a influence on the size of the executable cerated.

IMPORTANT! For SDL3 in particular, not all libraries have been updated to an official 3.0 release. As a result, packages lika SDL_mixer and SDL_net need to be built from source to be compatible with SDL3.  

### SDL3 on Ubuntu Linux

SDL3 is a very new release and has still not entered into package management in Ubuntu Linux. It will be installed by compiling the same. 

On Ubuntu linux, use the following command in the terminal to install the required libraries:

#### 1. Install CMake
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    

#### 2. Download SDL3 from here: [SDL3-3.2.8.tar.gz](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-3.2.8/SDL3-3.2.8.tar.gz)

#### 3. Extract the archive and compile
Open a terminal and go to Downloads folder
    $ cd ~/Downloads

Extract the downloaded file.
    $ tar -xf SDL3-3.2.4.tar.gz

 Go to the extracted archive : for example I have the archive in the downloads directory : 
    $ cd ~/Downloads/SDL3-3.2.4 

#### 4. Compile SDL3 and install
Issue the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
type c for configure
type c again
type g for generate
make
sudo make install
```
This will install _sdl3_ into the standard library on your distribution.

### SDL3 on Macos

On mac with _homebrew_ installed please use the following command in terminal to install the libraries:

    $ brew install sdl3 sdl3_image sdl3_ttf


### SDL3 on Windows

On widows with Msys2, please open the msys2 console and issue the following commands to install the SDL2 libraries.

    $ pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL3 mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL3-image mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL3-ttf

Answer _Y_ to proceed with the installation.

## Running the sdl hello program

In order to run the hello program using Makefile, rename the right makefile for you system. For example, on a Windows computer, rename _Makefile\_win_ to _Makefile_. 

Ensure the Makefile have the correct active lines of code for your version of SDL (2 or 3). 

Open a terminal and point the working directory to the project folder. Refer to the [_c\_programming\_intro_](https://github.com/Makerspace-KTH/c_programing_intro#4-launch-and-run-a-c-program) for details for your operating system.

Run the makefile based on your OS to build the _hello_ executable

Windows:

    $ mingw32-make.exe

Linux / macos:

    $ make

Execute the binary _hello_

    $ ./hello 

or

    $ ./hello.exe

Expected output:

![Expected Output](contents/expected-output.png?raw=true "Expected output")

Run

$ make clean

to remove the binaries.
