# Makefile for Mac

## Location of where hello.c is stored in
SRCDIR=./src

## Name of the compiler, GNU GCC in this case
CC=gcc

## Any include directories
INCLUDE = /opt/homebrew/include

## Any flags for the compiler
CFLAGS = -g -I$(INCLUDE) -c
#CFLAGS = -g -c

## Any libraries to link with
LIBS = /opt/homebrew/lib

## FOR SDL 2
## Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker
LDFLAGS = -lSDL2main -lSDL2

## FOR SDL3
## Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker
## Note: No -lSDL3main flag needed for SDL3, it is included in -lSDL3 as a header (see hello.c file).
#LDFLAGS = -lSDL3

## Build the correct hello source file according to your SDL version:
hello:
	@echo "Building Hello"
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRCDIR)/hello_sdl2.c -o $@.o
#	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRCDIR)/hello_sdl3.c -o $@.o 
	$(CC) hello.o -o hello $(LDFLAGS) -L $(LIBS)

clean:
	rm -f hello.o
	rm -f hello
