## Makefile for Windows

## Location of where hello.c is stored in
SRCDIR=./src

## Name of the compiler, GNU GCC in this case
CC=gcc

## Any include directories
# INCLUDE = ./lib/macos/include
INCLUDE = C:\msys64\mingw64\include

## Any flags for the compiler
#CFLAGS = -g -I$(INCLUDE) -c
CFLAGS = -g -c

## Any libraries to link with
#LIBS = C:\msys64\mingw64\lib

## For SDL2
## Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker
## NOTE ORDER OF THE FLAGS MATTERS!
LDFLAGS = -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -mwindows

## For SDL 3
## Note: No -lSDL3main flag needed for SDL3, it is included in -lSDL3 as a header (see hello.c file).
## NOTE ORDER OF THE FLAGS MATTERS!
#LDFLAGS = -lmingw32 -lSDL3 -mwindows

## Build the correct hello source file according to your SDL version:
hello:
	@echo "Building Hello"
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRCDIR)/hello_sdl2.c -o $@.o
#	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SRCDIR)/hello_sdl3.c -o $@.o 
	$(CC) hello.o -o hello $(LDFLAGS)

clean:
	del hello.exe
	del hello.o
